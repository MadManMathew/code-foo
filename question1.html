			<p class="contentText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				First we will make some assumptions: The engine is in the bus, and any storage compartments and filled.
				Also zero resources are available, ie dimensions of ping pong balls or bus.

				I will used my last experience of an average sized school bus and my own height as reference to make my best estimation.

				1)Split the insides of the bus in 3 sections. 
				    all the seating, the drivers section and the bottom steps.


				How long is the bus? 
				   Using my height as a guide roughly 5'9, from my back to my knees is aprox 2 feet.
				   Last time I was on a school bus my knees hit the from of the seat so 2 feet plus half of a foot for the seat.
				   On average you can fit say 40 people on a school bus 2 people per seat, 2 seats per row.
				   Leaving us with 10 rows.

				   10 * 2.5 feet + the drivers section that would be 1.5 times the seating section.

				How heigh is the seating area?
				   6 foot hight so most people can stand, the taller peple could not

				How wide is the bus.
				   a normal bus seats 4 per row and middle section, 1 person would be about 2 feet shoulder to shoulder.
				   the middle part would be about 1 person wide so 5 * 2 = 10 feet.

				10 * 6 * 28 =  1680 cubic feet

				add in the stairs estimation
				add in the front estimation.

				minus the seats + drivers seat

				get the total area

				estimate how many ping pong balls fit in a cubic foot

				do the math
