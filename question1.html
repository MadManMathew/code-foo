					<span class="questionHeader">Answer</span><br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assumptions: The engine is in the bus, and any storage compartments and filled. Also zero resources are available, ie dimensions of ping pong balls or bus.<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using my last experience of an average sized school bus and my own height as reference to make my best estimation on the total area of the bus. I will then estimate how many pingpong balls are in a cubic foot. It is easier to estimate on a smaller area than a larger one.<br>
				Split the insides of the bus in 3 sections. all the seating, the drivers section and the bottom steps. <img src="assets/bus1.png" width="30%"><br>
				How long is the section 1 the seating area?<br>
				<div style="margin-left:16px;" class="contentText">
					Using my height as a guide roughly 5'9, from my back to my knees is aprox 2 feet.<br>
					Last time I was on a school bus my knees hit the from of the seat so 2 feet plus half of a foot for the seat.<br>
					On average you can fit say 40 people on a school bus 2 people per seat, 2 seats per row. So 10 rows<br>
					If you take all the seat padding it would take up and estimate of .5 feet from top to bottom.<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 * 2.5 feet - .5 feet*10 pading<br>
				</div><img src="assets/bus2.png" width="10%"> <img src="assets/bus3.png" width="20%"><br>
				How heigh is the seating area?<br>
				<div style="margin-left:16px;" class="contentText">
					6 foot hight so most people can stand, the taller peple could not<br>
					<br>
				</div>How wide is the bus.<br>
				<div style="margin-left:16px;" class="contentText">
					a normal bus seats 4 per row and middle section, 1 person with a bit of space would be about 2 feet long. the middle part would be about 1 person wide so 5 * 2 = 10 feet.<br>
				</div>Drivers Area<br>
				<div style="margin-left:16px;" class="contentText">
					The drivers length is about 1.5 times the lenght of a seating area, but only has 1 side of seat.<br>
					The dirvers seat is usually bulkier so it would take the same about of space as 2<br>
					(2.5 - .5) * 1.5
				</div>Stairs Area<br>
				<div style="margin-left:16px;" class="contentText">
					length: same as driver : 2.5 * 1.5 height: approx 4 feet width: 1/3 of bus of 10/3 = 3 divide by 2 for stairs estimate ((2.5* 1.5 )*3*3)/2
				</div>section 1) 1200 cubic feet<br>
				section 2) 180 cubic feet section 3) 16 cubic feet estimate how many ping pong balls is roughly 1.5 inches. so 8 pingpong per foot lenghts to 8*8*8 = 512 (1200 + 180 + 16)*512 =~ 715,000
