					<span class="questionHeader">Answer</span><br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assumptions: The engine is in the bus, and any storage compartments and filled. Also zero resources are available, ie dimensions of ping pong balls or bus. You cannot crush the ping pong balls<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using my last experience of an average sized school bus and my own height as reference to make my best estimation on the total area of the bus. I will then estimate how many pingpong balls are in a cubic foot. <br>
				Split the insides of the bus in 3 sections. all the seating, the drivers section and the bottom steps. <img src="assets/bus1.png" width="30%"><br>
				How long is the section 1 the seating area?<br>
				<div style="margin-left:16px;" class="contentText">
					Using my height as a guide roughly 5'9, from my back to my knees is aprox 2 feet.<br>
					Last time I was on a school bus my knees hit the from of the seat so 2 feet plus half of a foot for the seat.<br>
					On average you can fit say 40 people on a school bus 2 people per seat, 2 seats per row. So 10 rows<br>
					If you take all the seat padding it would take up and estimate of .5 feet from top to bottom.<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 * 2.5 feet<br>
				</div><img src="assets/bus2.png" width="10%"> <img src="assets/bus3.png" width="20%"><br>
				How heigh is the seating area?<br>
				<div style="margin-left:16px;" class="contentText">
					6 foot hight so most people can stand, the taller people could not<br>
					<br>
				</div>How wide is the bus?<br>
				<div style="margin-left:16px;" class="contentText">
					a normal bus seats 4 per row and middle section, 1 person with a bit of space would be about 2 feet long. the middle part would be about 1 person wide so 5 * 2 = 10 feet.<br>
				</div>Drivers Area + stair area<br>
				<div style="margin-left:16px;" class="contentText">
					The drivers length is about 1.5 times the lenght of a seating area, but only has 1 side of seat.<br>
					(2.5 ) * 1.5</br>
				<div style="margin-left:16px;" class="contentText">
					VolumeOfSection1 - VolumeOfSeating + VolumeOfSection2 + (VolumeSection3 - DriverSeat) = totalVol; 
				</div>
				section 1) 1200 cubic feet<br/>
				section 2+3) 180 cubic feet section<br/> 
				estimate how many ping pong balls is roughly 1.5 inches in diameter<br/>
				vol (4/3)*pi*(1.5/2)^3 = 1.8; inches
				12*12*12 / 960 ansser
				Upper Bound
				Lower Bound is there cubes
				12*12*12/(1.5^3) = 512
				 <br/>
				(1200 + 225 )*960 =~ 715,000<br/>
