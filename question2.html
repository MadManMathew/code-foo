		<p class="contentText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to create a webpage for all of my question and incorporating Question 2. This site is a Liquid layout using HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as JQuery. Liquid layout sizes are set relative to the window size, not absolute in pixels. They are beneficial for different resolutions, as resolutions change the dimension change to match the percentages. This lets you used more screen real-estate if it is available.</p>
		<p class="contentText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While creating this webpage I noticed that when using the percentages "%" it uses only the width's percentage. Thus if you want to use height percentages you need to manually calculated it using Javascript or you can also use inherit.</p>
